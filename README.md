C# and .NET

  This repositiry contains files and programs I have written during my coding bootcamp at The Tech Academy. using Visual Studio Community, here I showcase Console Apps (with and without using .NET Framewrok, ASP.NET Web Apps, and ASP.NET Core Web Apps. Utilizing not only C#, but also using Razor, which combines C# and HTML. I also incorperate EntityFramework 6.0, SQL, T-SQL, and other add-ons into my projects. I also demonstrate knowledge of the CodeFirst and Model-View-Controller approaches to programming. The bigger and flashier projects that I am proud of in this Repository are my Car Insurance Web App and Blackjack Console Game.

Blackjack Console Game:

  This is a Console App written in C# that not only lets you play a text-based version of the classic card game, but also records what cards were dealt/played and when into a text file!

Car Insurance Web App:

  This is an ASP.NET Web App (using the MVC approach) that gives a user a quick calculation that produces a quote for their insurance premium, based off several factors. The Web App records all entries, using T-SQL, and provides an administrator view that gives further options to delete or edit users and their info.
